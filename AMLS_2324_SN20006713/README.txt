# Binary & Multi Classification Problem through Deep Learning and Machine Learning

## Overview
This project involves two datasets: the Pneumonia dataset and the Path MNIST dataset. The Pneumonia dataset contains chest X-ray images for classifying pneumonia, while the Path MNIST dataset includes images of tissues for classification.

## Folder Structur
- **A & B**: Contains Jupyter notebooks used for model training, evaluation, and visualization (contains pre-trained model also).
- **Datasets**: Contains datasets used for training, validation, and testing.

## Files
- **PneumoniaMNIST.ipynb**: Notebook for model training for Pneumonia dataset.
- **PathMNIST.ipynb**: Notebook for model evaluation and performance metrics.
- **main.py**: Python script for loading the pre-trained model and classifying images.

## Pretrained Model
A pre-trained model has been saved in the respective directory. This model was trained on the Pneumonia and Path MNIST datasets.

## Usage
To run the project:
1. Use `PneumoniaMNIST.ipynb` and `PathMNIS` to train the model on the datasets.
2. Use `main.py` to load the pre-trained model and classify images.

## Packages Required
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- tensorflow
- opencv-python

Ensure these packages are installed before running the project.
